# SD PYTHON 2024
I am glad to welcome everyone to the course dedicated to programming in Python!
Below you will find instructions on how to work with GitHub.

# Getting started
1. Sign up for It using your email: [GitHub](https://github.com /). If you haven't account
2. Download and install Git Bash:: [Git for PC](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Log in to Git Bash. Instructions [here](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html)
4. Create a folder on your PC where you will store the course files. This is your local repository.
5. Copy the files from my repository to your folder. To do this, you need to::

    a) Open the Git Bash command prompt and go to your local repository folder. Use the cd command.

   b) After you are sure that you are in the right folder, clone the repository to yourself with the command below::
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nustmisis/edu_python_nlp_2023
   ```
   c) A folder with files should appear in your folder. One of the folders will be called ".git". .

6. To send files from your local folder to a remote repository, go to the folder with ".git" foleder and use the commands below

   [link] - that's a link to your git repository. Example: https://github.com/nustmisis/edu_python_nlp_2023
   
   
  ```
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add pythonrep [link]
git push -u pythonrep main
   ```

You are amazing, the files have appeared on the remote client. You can refresh the repository page and see your work. 

This is enough to get started with GitHub. Below you will find useful (or not so useful) tips for your further work with Git.

If you are allergic to the CLI. Use the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)  to work with git inside vs code

# How to sent home work

I will send a link similar to this one *https://classroom.github.com/a/uI4Ehkwu* (example)

This is a link to the GitHub Classroom. You click on it and are added to our class on GitHub. A repository is automatically created on your account, in which you will need to commit the homework files before the specified deadline.
